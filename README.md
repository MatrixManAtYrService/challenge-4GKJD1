Astronomer QA Team Coding Challenges
====================================

Hi, we're glad you're interested in joining our team.
We want to talk with you about code, so we've prepared some challenges.

You will not be scored on your submissions here, so don't stress.
This is just a conversation starter.

Challenges 1-3 involve submitting a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) to this repo.
Challenge 4 asks you to comment on an issue.
(If you don't have a github account, you'll want to [create one](https://github.com/))


1. [Gibberish Converter](one/README.md)
2. [Palendrome Checker](two/README.md)
3. [Who is Awake?](three/README.md)
4. [Bug or Feature?](four/README.md)


Pick one from the list above and give it a try.
If it was easy, try another.
If you don't like it, try a different one.
Whatever you do, please don't spend more than an hour or two on any of this (unless you're having fun).
Also don't be afraid to submit broken, incomplete, or otherwise problematic work--whatever it is, it'll give us something to talk about.

Lastly, even if you don't choose to complete it, take a glance at [challenge 4](four/README.md).
That's [Apache Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow) you're seeing there.
If it looks interesting to you, you're in the right place.

Thanks for taking the time to do this, we look forward to talking with you soon.
